Jake       2/6/2001 7:25 PM  how do you plan to compensate the design?

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:25 PM  I plan to pay also, if you guys are as good as
                                  you say you are..I will use you permanetly and
                                  will pay you for my other sites.

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:26 PM  Well id like the free design on your
                                  site...and ill put your banner up on my site
                                  like it says.

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:27 PM  And if i like what i see at the end, I will
                                  pay you for all my other sites, and for
                                  anything else i need.

Jake       2/6/2001 7:27 PM  ok

Jake       2/6/2001 7:29 PM  all I need is a moch up or a template of what
                                  you want the site to look like

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:30 PM  Well see thats the thing, im not sure how i
                                  want the site to look...I was hoping you guys
                                  could help with that part also =P

Jake       2/6/2001 7:30 PM  that's fine, but it will take a lot longer to
                                  do, because we have so many offers right now

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:30 PM  oh :/

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:31 PM  So either way i wont be able to get my site
                                  doen for a while?

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:31 PM  done*

Jake       2/6/2001 7:31 PM  the longest it will take is the end of march

Jake       2/6/2001 7:31 PM  LONGEST

Jake       2/6/2001 7:31 PM  I'd say by the end of February, if not sooner

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:32 PM  All i know is I love graphics, I think
                                  graphics are what make a site...I know this
                                  because I know teens love graphics...and I
                                  know myself as an 18 year old I love to see
                                  sites with alot of neat graphics on them.

Jake       2/6/2001 7:33 PM  understood

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:34 PM  I love blues, sky blues..I dont like dark
                                  sites though...I can send you a .txt with some
                                  sites i think are good...and what i like and
                                  what i dont like to help you guys out
                                  more...if you want..

Jake       2/6/2001 7:34 PM  that'd be great

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:35 PM  awesome =)

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:36 PM  Remember im not just trying to get a free
                                  site, like most. I went to your site not
                                  knowing about this free deal...and was
                                  planning to pay and im sure I will invest in
                                  you guys in the future. But hey if i can get a
                                  free site..why the hell not? =) And if i like
                                  it, which im sure I will...I will pay you guys
                                  to maintain my site or so my other web sites
                                  and projects.

Jake       2/6/2001 7:37 PM  good deal =)

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:38 PM  I also kind of wanted some programming done,
                                  How much do you guys charge for something like
                                  that? Maybe some things where teens can submit
                                  stories like teenstuff.com...or post
                                  profiles...something not complex.

Jake       2/6/2001 7:38 PM  depends on a lot of things

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:55 PM  you guys have a fax?

Jake       2/6/2001 7:56 PM  yes, but it's not available right now

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:58 PM  k

PIERCED    2/6/2001 7:59 PM  Ok, so where do we go from here...I know your
                                  busy and dont plan to bother you much..just
                                  need to make sure we are on the same level
                                  here..

Jake       2/6/2001 8:00 PM  e-mail Jake@dynamixpro.com with all the
                                  information we need, such as site name, site
                                  url, navigation headings, graphic ideas, etc. 
                                  and we'll let you know from there

PIERCED    2/6/2001 8:00 PM  ok, thanks.

PIERCED    2/8/2001 7:03 PM  Hey jake

PIERCED    2/8/2001 7:04 PM  How much would it cost to get something like
                                  http://penpals.teenchatway.com/penpals.pl
                                  made...without the search and all that complex
                                  stuff made. I just want it simple..but to be
                                  able to give the users the ability to create a
                                  profile...

Jake       2/8/2001 7:06 PM  not that much, I cant really say without
                                  talkin with our programmers

PIERCED    2/8/2001 7:07 PM  ok, well get back to me =) and ill have the
                                  descriptions and what   I want for my site
                                  emailed to you friday...that cool? Just been
                                  busy with work and all..

Jake       2/8/2001 7:08 PM  so have I =)

PIERCED    2/8/2001 7:08 PM  hehe =)

PIERCED    2/10/200 3:28 PM  Hey I emailed you today on what I want for
                                  teenchill.com, Hope to here from you soon,
                                  cya.

PIERCED    2/10/200 3:38 PM  I noticed the free web design offer is off
                                  your site....do i still get this offer or do I
                                  have to pay for it now?

Jake       2/10/200 6:02 PM  you are still going to get the free offer, it
                                  will just not be allowed to anyone else
                                  anymore.  that is why we took it down

PIERCED    2/11/200 1:31 PM  Great.

PIERCED    2/11/200 2:31 PM  ok, remember that ill pay for anything
                                  extra...graphics, flash, etc. cya

PIERCED    2/11/200 2:33 PM  Hey jake, did ya get my email...if you did
                                  what do you think..

Jake       2/11/200 2:33 PM  sounds good, I've got to get rolling though,
                                  only have a few mins...

Jake       2/11/200 2:34 PM  I'll talk to ya later and get rollin on the
                                  project

PIERCED    2/16/200 11:37 AM You guys hav'nt emailed me yet about my
                                  project, is there something wrong?

Jake       2/17/200 12:13 AM we're busy

PIERCED    2/17/200 12:22 PM Well please just email me when you are ready.

PIERCED    2/20/200 5:19 PM  still no email from dynamixpro : /

PIERCED    2/20/200 5:19 PM  I just want some kind of feedback, just to
                                  know im a taken care of customer =)

Jake       2/20/200 5:20 PM  you're not a customer

Jake       2/20/200 5:21 PM  be patient, we have a lot of other "free
                                  sites" going on right now, as well as paying
                                  clients.  you're just in line, so wait
                                  patiently please

PIERCED    2/20/200 5:24 PM  That's rude. Yes, I am a customer...Im willing
                                  to pay..for all your services and I wasnt
                                  looking for this free site deal. Just forget
                                  about the free site and let me be a paying
                                  customer if this will make my site process go
                                  any faster.

PIERCED    2/20/200 5:25 PM  I just want some kind of feedback from you
                                  guys, Im not asking for much and  I have been
                                  patient. Im willing to spend alot of money
                                  with you guys and even told you myself. Seems
                                  you guys don't really care about my business.

Jake       2/20/200 5:43 PM  I'm afraid you're wrong there.  We sincerely
                                  care about your business, but as I've said
                                  every time you've asked me, we will notify you
                                  once we are free to work on your site. 
                                  However, being a paying customer does indeed
                                  make the process go faster, and you would go
                                  from end of the line to top priority, no
                                  questions asked.

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:06 PM  Then let me pay.

Jake       2/20/200 6:07 PM  I was never stopping you

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:07 PM  I told you I wasnt looking for a free site
                                  when I went to dynamixpro.

Jake       2/20/200 6:07 PM  that's fine

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:07 PM  I just want quality work, and my site with
                                  alot of graphics like curve.com has...I think
                                  I already emailed you all I want, but I can
                                  email you again if needed.

Jake       2/20/200 6:08 PM  I don't recall that e-mail, I get plenty of
                                  them every day, so you may need to send it
                                  again =( sorry

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:08 PM  ok, no problem.

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:10 PM  I havnt seen alot of your graphic work but do
                                  you think you guys could make a site like
                                  http://www.curve.com/en/curve.jhtml
                                  

Jake       2/20/200 6:10 PM  if you want, I can give you a very rough
                                  estimate if you just tell me how many pages,
                                  will you need flash, do you need database of
                                  programming management, and do you need us to
                                  continue updating the site in the future?

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:10 PM  as of now all I need is the index.html

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:11 PM  with alot of graphics, probably.

Jake       2/20/200 6:11 PM  ok

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:11 PM  Something that will catch a teens eye,
                                  remember this is a teen site.

Jake       2/20/200 6:12 PM  understood

Jake       2/20/200 6:12 PM  bright colors, flashy animation, lots of
                                  imagery

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:12 PM  exactly =)

Jake       2/20/200 6:12 PM  if you just need the template page, that will
                                  only be NO MORE than $300

Jake       2/20/200 6:13 PM  considering all the work needed

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:13 PM  hmm, ok.

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:14 PM  After the site is done, I will make the
                                  decision if I want you guys to keep updating
                                  my site or do the rest of my pages I need.

Jake       2/20/200 6:14 PM  that's perfectly fine, in fact it wouldn't
                                  make sense to do it any other way, hehe

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:14 PM  depends if the site is complex and if the html
                                  is tricky, I dont want to mess anything up =P

Jake       2/20/200 6:15 PM  I had someone do that once, I made the site,
                                  and they completely screwed it up by "just
                                  adding something"
                                  
                                  not a good thing

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:15 PM  Ive been to plenty of places though man, none
                                  have meat my expectations.

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:15 PM  ya, it happens.

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:15 PM  met*

Jake       2/20/200 6:16 PM  that's the thing, you won't pay until your
                                  expectations ARE MET with us...

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:16 PM  thats great =)

Jake       2/20/200 6:16 PM  customer service should be

Jake       2/20/200 6:17 PM  so, all I need is for you to fill out

                                  and then we'll give you information pertaining
                                  to the down payment, and then we'll get to
                                  work within 24 hours of that down payment
                                  clearing

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:17 PM  how much is the down payment?

Jake       2/20/200 6:18 PM  35% of the official quoted price

PIERCED    2/20/200 6:18 PM  What should I put in the description...since

                                  do/add, like flash or any other complex work,

PIERCED    3/11/200 4:42 PM  I already emailed you like 3 days ago

Jake       3/11/200 5:43 PM  we just showed you the recent changes...you
                                  haven't said anything about them

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:43 PM  I emailed you...

Jake       3/11/200 5:43 PM  about adding one more graphic, I know!  We
                                  then showed you the additions

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:44 PM  err, no...I emailed you!

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:44 PM  Did you even check your email...

Jake       3/11/200 5:44 PM  I check it many times per day
                                  

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:44 PM  I emailed you about the new site you guys came
                                  up with..

Jake       3/11/200 5:44 PM  This site is better I like the teen chat
                                  network graphic, but that was the only graphic
                                  added. I had asked for maybe 1 or 2 more. To
                                  make things easier...this is what I want done,
                                  In between the skater guy pic and the email
                                  login I'd like the most awesome graphic you
                                  guys can come up with, PLEASE. I'd like it to
                                  be a teen chill graphic though because I only
                                  got one small one and thats on the very top
                                  frame. Create the graphic anyway you guys
                                  like. Also, you know how the bottom of the
                                  graphics have a circled corner? Well, I'd like
                                  those to be straight...I just dont like the
                                  way it looks. I'd like the bottom space to be
                                  straigt to, No corners on the bottom. The only
                                  one I'd like to stay with bottom circled
                                  corners is the email login, can you add a
                                  circled corner to the right side to though?
                                  I'm not sure if you get what I'm saying but I
                                  hope you do =)
                                  
                                  I also have a couple more questions..I noticed
                                  the site is like a real big graphic....with
                                  not much html. Will this change? Is it just
                                  because this is a beta site? Im just wondering
                                  this because if I decided to update things
                                  myself it will be hard with just graphics. I
                                  also wanted to know how much you would charge
                                  me to do a message boards site...meaning you
                                  install them (if you guys install) on my site
                                  and design the site. Which would mean my
                                  website would be a 2 page site instead of 1.
                                  Oh ya, one more thing...can you change the
                                  SEACH and MAILING list to just free space for
                                  me...I'm not going to offer search or a
                                  mailing list, not at this time anyways. Thanks
                                  again for all your guys help and hopefully
                                  this will be the last design
                                  

Jake       3/11/200 5:44 PM  that is the last email we received from you

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:45 PM  I know...and you havnt done anything new with
                                  the site..

Jake       3/11/200 5:46 PM  http://xebex.net/ai9/teenchill

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:46 PM  its the same...

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:46 PM  the teen chat network graphics is
                                  there...thats it...I already saw that site..

Jake       3/11/200 5:47 PM  ok, I'll show you the update later this
                                  evening.  did you want to send a fax to us
                                  still?

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:47 PM  Naw...its ok.
                                  
                                  You never answered my other questions in that
                                  email either..

Jake       3/11/200 5:47 PM  the site WILL NOT be all graphics

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:48 PM  that was just one question :P

Jake       3/11/200 5:48 PM  what do you mean by a message board site?

Jake       3/11/200 5:48 PM  a site that is just a message board?

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:48 PM  Like ya know...message boards...look at
                                  http://boards.neonteen.com
                                  
                                  ya know...message boards =P

Jake       3/11/200 5:49 PM  not much more, maybe $60

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:49 PM  what about the msg board program, etc. 

Jake       3/11/200 5:50 PM  we could get a free script program

Jake       3/11/200 5:50 PM  that is very nice as well, so don't worry
                                  about it being cruddy

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:51 PM  most of those suck....well most of the ones
                                  ive looked at...

Jake       3/11/200 5:51 PM  I would use phpBB, which is a very versatile,
                                  stable script.

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:51 PM  ok cool

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:52 PM  You have a demo of it?

Jake       3/11/200 5:52 PM  www.phpbb.com

Jake       3/11/200 5:52 PM  just look at it there =)

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:52 PM  ok...so what do you think you can do with teen
                                  chill...were my demands to much?

Jake       3/11/200 5:53 PM  not at all.  In fact, we should be done as
                                  soon as we fix those changes you just asked
                                  for

PIERCED    3/11/200 5:54 PM  I just dont like the corners...feel it needs
                                  another teen chill graphic...
