=====================

WarningTrack: Hi Jake
Jake13735: hey
WarningTrack: This is Chris Bowyer, co-owner of TheStands.com
WarningTrack: I come to make a request of you.
Jake13735: oh, hello
Jake13735: ok, what's the request?
WarningTrack: We are trying to add FastClick.com ad banners to our site - we were attempting to setup an ad rotator so that we could rotate the FastClick banners with your own. However, this is not possible. :-( I was wondering if you were open to modifying our advertising arranagement at all?
Jake13735: why isn't that possible, first of all?
WarningTrack: Because FastClick's banner code does not give us one specific URL we can enter into the rotator.
WarningTrack: This doesn't surprise me, I suspected we might run into such a difficulty.
Jake13735: what script are you trying to run...for your banner rotation?
WarningTrack: phpAds - why?
Jake13735: try adcycle
Jake13735: works for DynamixPro
WarningTrack: For both plain banner rotators as well as ad networks like FastClick? FastClick isn't the same as Burst!Media or other such providers, mind you
WarningTrack: I've found Burst's code to be much simpler
Jake13735: why use fastclicks then?
WarningTrack: Because Burst has rejected us
Jake13735: use websitesponsors, they pay out a lot better, better support, and they work with adcycle
Jake13735: burst sucks...mind you :P
WarningTrack: Yes, they do - WS Sponsors pays by the click last I checked, however.
WarningTrack: FastClicks is a CPM provider, which is what we want, and need
Jake13735: hmm
WarningTrack: Anyway, I come with an offer
Jake13735: I'm listening
WarningTrack: Alright
WarningTrack: It's quite simple: we keep that button on the navbar up as long as we use your design, we thank you specially with an announcement on all our forums, post a new story thanking you on our site as if it were content, and keep your 468x60 banner up on one of our branch sites without any rotating (only banner on there), if we can use the banner space on the other branch sites for the FastClick banners
WarningTrack: I figure this will work out better for both of us, as we plan to go with a new layout shortly anyway.
Jake13735: why are you going to a new layout?
WarningTrack: Because we'd like something flat-out amazing. Your layout is good and solid - don't get me wrong. We're basically saving our money to hire someone who is *incredibly* expensive, but is a friend of mine, as fate would have it. He's from Scotland, and does web design for a living. Has for quite some time.
WarningTrack: I hope that doesn't rub you the wrong way.
Jake13735: well, it most certainly does
WarningTrack: Why's that?
Jake13735: what do you mean why
WarningTrack: Why would you be upset by this?
WarningTrack: I don't see why at all
Jake13735: I don't see how it can't be offensive
WarningTrack: You'll have to enlighten me here, Jake
Jake13735: you just blatantly stated that our work isn't worth saving your money for
WarningTrack: No, all I've implied is that you're not as good as this person I know, which is nothing to be ashamed of, seeing as how he is one of the best around.
WarningTrack: I'm not insulted if someone tells me they know of a better PHP programmer
WarningTrack: Because I know I'm not the best
Jake13735: well, that's your choice I suppose
Jake13735: if you think what we did for thestands network sites is our best, you're sadly mistaken
WarningTrack: I make no such assumption
Jake13735: ok
WarningTrack: I only know that if I'm going to spend what will be quite a bit of money to someone of my age, I'd like to spend it on someone who I have worked with on large-scale project in the past in much detail
WarningTrack: So your being offended by it baffles me
Jake13735: no offense, but that isn't much to base spending money on
Jake13735: granted, trusting your "friend" is a big deal, and I understand that
WarningTrack: Moreso than I can say for you - I have to base it on something
Jake13735: spending a lot of money doesn't mean you're going to get what the money spent deserves
WarningTrack: I know Jack, and have worked with him. Perhaps you are better - might be, I cannot say. However I know this person fairly well and have worked with him, so I don't see why I would go any other way than the safest, which is with him
Jake13735: the name is Jake
WarningTrack: Jack is the friend's name
Jake13735: oh, my mistake
WarningTrack: Correct, but which way is safer for me: with someone who I've hardly worked with at all, or someone who is a friend of mine and I've worked with in much detail before?
Jake13735: :P
Jake13735: I'm not by any means saying you should decide against using your friend
WarningTrack: Then what are you saying?
Jake13735: I'm just saying it's quite rude to say what you have said thus far
WarningTrack: What specifically has been rude, in your opinion?
Jake13735: "No, all I've implied is that you're not as good as this person I know, which is nothing to be ashamed of, seeing as how he is one of the best around."
WarningTrack: Actually yo usaid you were offended before I said that
Jake13735: whether it be true or not is besides the point.  that's like telling your girlfriend she looks fat in a dress when she asks "how do I look?"
Jake13735: I was offended, but not by rudeness
Jake13735: I was offended by assumption...
WarningTrack: Ugh - then by what?
Jake13735: irrelevant
Jake13735: I'm fine with you spending a ton of money, if you feel that is what determines quality.
WarningTrack: Ok, let me put it this way: there is the POSSIBILITY that you're better, but it's highly unlikely. If that offends you, well I cannot help it. It should not be an offensive statement - this person is 29 years old and has been doing this professionaly for years
Jake13735: if you trust your friend, then you should by all means hire him
Jake13735: you shouldn't go around being God like that though, that's my point
WarningTrack: If someone tells me they're going with someone with lots of experience whom they know personally and believe to be better, I would not be offended in the least. Not even close
WarningTrack: Being God?
WarningTrack: Is that some kind of joke?
Jake13735: not at all
Jake13735: if you think your friend is better, keep it to yourself.
WarningTrack: So, because I think that this designer is better than you, I'm being God?
Jake13735: it's rude to do otherwise
WarningTrack: I was going to, but you asked me why we were changing layouts
WarningTrack: I didn't WANT to talk about it
WarningTrack: It would have been rude if I had refused to answer
Jake13735: ok, whatever.  I don't want to argue over something so childish
WarningTrack: Whatever you say jake, but you just told me I should have kept it to myself, I then pointed out that you ASKED me, and then you don't want to talk about it anymore.
WarningTrack: Because of that, the entire point of this conversation has gone off track. Everytime I say something I'm met with either a question, or a statement telling me I'm rude, or God.
Jake13735: have you kept this entire conversation saved?
WarningTrack: I havn't closed it - why?
Jake13735: then reread what I've stated 
WarningTrack: I know what you've said.
Jake13735: I'm agreeing with your choice
WarningTrack: I tried to make an offer, you started asking questions, which I answered, even though they got tiresome
Jake13735: not with your choice of statements
WarningTrack: You're not understanding me
WarningTrack: You're misunderstanding Jake - you got upset, told me I shouldn't have done something, and then I came back telling you you ASKED about it, so I told you. Therefore what you said was wrong
Jake13735: you're extremely ignorant...
WarningTrack: I wouldn't have mentioned it, except for the fact that I don't like being insulted for no reason
WarningTrack: And why is that, Jake?
Jake13735: did you not read my statement about the analogy to a girlfriend asking "how do I look?"
WarningTrack: Yes, and it was a bad analogy
WarningTrack: You're a professional, not my girlfriend. I should not have to humor you or message your ego
WarningTrack: massage*
Jake13735: message
WarningTrack: Now, did you read my IM rebutting your point of keeping it to myself?
Jake13735: i'm not asking you to message my ego, I'm asking you to act professional
WarningTrack: Same of you - and as a professional, realize that it's highly likely that this friend of mine is a better designer.
Jake13735: I've already agreed to that if you'd get off your podium and stop preeching
Jake13735: you could realize that
WarningTrack: This is not preaching - this is asking you to admit when you've said something wrong, which you simply will not do.
Jake13735: what have I said incorrectly?
WarningTrack: That I should have kept it to myself
WarningTrack: When you ASKED me about it
WarningTrack: And I supposed it would have been perfectly polite to not answer the question?
Jake13735: your ignorance is starting to frustrate me
WarningTrack: Are you going to respond, or insult me again?
Jake13735: I asked for your reason for a new layout of the network sites
WarningTrack: Yes, and I told you why
Jake13735: claiming your friend to be superior to me was highly unnecessary.  that is all I am trying to say
Jake13735: I can accept my inadequacy to your friend
Jake13735: but I refuse to accept your rudeness
WarningTrack: Rudeness?
Jake13735: must I explain it again
WarningTrack: Tell me, which of us has called the other ignorant several times?
WarningTrack: Which has accused the other of playing God?
WarningTrack: And now, which of us has done NONE of that?
Jake13735: does that make you right, and me wrong?
WarningTrack: You're as guilty as I, if not moreso
Jake13735: guilty of what, may I ask
WarningTrack: No, it makes you ruder than I in this conversation
WarningTrack: Of this rudeness you seem so terribly offended by
Jake13735: calling you ignorant is not an insult
WarningTrack: Are you kidding me?
Jake13735: ignorance is a lack of understanding or knowledge
WarningTrack: Yes, it is
WarningTrack: That's an insult
WarningTrack: So let me guess: it's not an insult because it might be true?
Jake13735: well, then claiming I lack the experience, or talent...or both, to your friend Jack is just as big an insult...am I wrong?
WarningTrack: SEE! That's my point exactly, you did the exact same thing as I
Jake13735: no, it can be seen as an insult, I suppose, but it wasn't intended to be as such
WarningTrack: So don't go on about my rudeness when you have done all I have
WarningTrack: Well neither was mine
WarningTrack: So as you can see, I've done no worse than you
Jake13735: if that makes you feel better, than I'll agree with you
Jake13735: I've done wrong, in calling you ignorant.
Jake13735: I'm sorry, here is a cookie
WarningTrack: Very funny
WarningTrack: And this after ranting on and on about how rude I am?
WarningTrack: All of a sudden it's trivial?
Jake13735: as I said earlier, you're frustrating me
Jake13735: you keep backtracking and quite frankly you've just wasted twenty minutes of my time
WarningTrack: Likewise - however, as you can plainly see, all your argument has been in vain, as you've said these rude things more often than I have
Jake13735: how have I been rude, please explain
WarningTrack: I just did explain it to you Jake
Jake13735: *sigh*
WarningTrack: And you admitted that you've done wrong in calling me ignorant
WarningTrack: Sigh all you want, but you've got nothing rational on your side at this point
Jake13735: is this a game?
Jake13735: do you really want to win that badly?
WarningTrack: No, not at all
WarningTrack: Nope, not about winning
Jake13735: my God you're insane!
WarningTrack: Yeah Jake, I'm insane
WarningTrack: It's about getting you to realize that after all this ranting and raving on your end, you did the same damn thing! Is that so hard to understand?
Jake13735: all I said was saying your friend is superior to me, was unncessary, which is most certainly is, and was
WarningTrack: Read my last IM - if you have a rational reply, go ahead and send it.
Jake13735: and now you're off on a spree of how incorrect I am here, and incorrect there..
WarningTrack: Nope, I'm simply repeating myself - you don't seem to get it
WarningTrack: Could be worse, I could call you rude, God, ignoant, and insane
Jake13735: quite the contrary, I've admitted my fault....you're unable to do so yourself
WarningTrack: And what makes you say that? You hadn't asked me. You'd simply been insulting me more and more
Jake13735: you are rude, you are ignorant, and this is insane
Jake13735: this is beyond insane
WarningTrack: And what am I ignorant to?
Jake13735: this is ludicrous
Jake13735: eeek, bad spelling
WarningTrack: You're right, it is
Jake13735: youre unable to realize how unncessary your comments were
WarningTrack: It's totally insane for me to IM you with an offer, and then be hit with tons of questions about every little thing
Jake13735: I'm sick of arguing
WarningTrack: So am I, but I'll defend myself as long as I have to
Jake13735: naturally, when you bring up the fact you're replacing my work, I ask questions as to why
Jake13735: defend yourself?  lol that's exactly my point
Jake13735: this isn't a game Chris, nobody is fighting
WarningTrack: Yes, and then you should act professional when you get an honest answer.
WarningTrack: You know what I mean - you say something that's wrong, I reply. Simple
Jake13735: it wasn't a professional answer, why can't you realize that?
Jake13735: now my statements are wrong?
Jake13735: good luck in the business world
WarningTrack: The one about me being ignorant is

-----------------------
WarningTrack: I've emailed you, and unless you're the same through email as you are on IMs, you'll read it
Jake13735: lol
WarningTrack: Yes, laugh. Laugh some more if you like
Jake13735: lol
WarningTrack: There, doesn't that feel better?
WarningTrack: Perhaps you feel good enough to give me another lecture on business?
Jake13735: no, but reading this email does
WarningTrack: I'd enjoy that
WarningTrack: Well, why don't you correct me? After all, I could use all the advice I can get from someone like you
Jake13735: have you ever been in a fist fight in your life?
Jake13735: I'm curious
WarningTrack: Yup
WarningTrack: Fifth grade was the one I remember most
Jake13735: how much did you get beat up by?
Jake13735: on a scale of 1 to 10
WarningTrack: I didn't
Jake13735: how did it start?
Jake13735: did you say the other guy wasn't as good as your friend at soccer?
WarningTrack: Basically, the kid had been angry at me for some reason for days
WarningTrack: I never knew why
WarningTrack: Then one day he grabbed a paper of mine, messed it all up and threw it. I got it back, and eventually we fought for a short while. We weren't that old, of course
WarningTrack: Is this going somewhere?
Jake13735: nope
WarningTrack: I didn't think sop
WarningTrack: so*
WarningTrack: Somehow I thought you'd ask me something like that.
Jake13735: I had to after your little email
WarningTrack: You likely think I'm a sniveling worm who loves to debate, but not fight. If that's what you want to think, sure, go ahead
Jake13735: I did think you like to debate
Jake13735: but didnt think of you as a worm
WarningTrack: Well, you think of me as someone who is physically weak
WarningTrack: Who tries to make up for it with words
Jake13735: more of a snake, who bites and then coils up quickly after
WarningTrack: Who could not stand my ground in an actual fist fight
Jake13735: no, I didn't
WarningTrack: Coiling? Interesting - explain mroe
WarningTrack: more*
Jake13735: sheesh you're judging me now too
Jake13735: man oh man
WarningTrack: Nope, I'm trying to figure out what you're thinking
Jake13735: how do you have a 29 year old friend by the way?
WarningTrack: What do you mean how?
Jake13735: from scottland of all places
WarningTrack: You don't have any friends who are adults?
WarningTrack: Scotland - yes. Met him online through a work project.
WarningTrack: Was blown away by his skill
Jake13735: mind if I ask to see some of his work?
WarningTrack: www.reblock.net - although that's Flash, so it's not as accurate for, say, a content-based site
WarningTrack: The layout he built for the work project is actually still undergoing some changes - the site launches in a short while
WarningTrack: I don't know what company he works for. I'll have to ask
WarningTrack: Any other questions? I'm here to please
Jake13735: I'm rather ashamed you're judging DynamixPro based on a project we did for free...
Jake13735: ...now that I think about it
WarningTrack: Well, I'm open to any other examples
Jake13735: I'm not here to please
WarningTrack: I just didn't see anything at your site that looked better than what I've seen Jack create, is all
WarningTrack: And it seemed pretty obvious to me that your best work would be there
WarningTrack: Was I mistaken?
Jake13735: just mislead
WarningTrack: So, your best work is or isn't on this page ---> http://www.dynamixpro.com/clients/ ?
Jake13735: you don't see the big picture of anything
Jake13735: ..that is there
WarningTrack: How do you mean?
Jake13735: all we did on those, was develop something they wanted...
Jake13735: didn't go our own creative way or anything
Jake13735: so as I said earlier, judging DynamixPro, based on what you know about your friend Jackie, is quite irrelevant
WarningTrack: Well, from what I understand it is customary to put your best work on such a page - do you have any examples?
WarningTrack: No, just not 100% accurate
WarningTrack: Like I said before, you may be better, but I find that to be very unlikely
Jake13735: you think I have examples growing on the example tree?
WarningTrack: Nope, just figured you'd have at least one to show me
Jake13735: how many do you want me to come up with in four months?
WarningTrack: Well, I was thinking you'd have one by now.
WarningTrack: If you don't have any, then don't be surprised when people don't realize how great you are.
Jake13735: wasn't it you who was just viewing the client list?
WarningTrack: Yup, I was.
Jake13735: there are half a dozen examples there...
WarningTrack: You said those arn't ones where you got to go your own creative way
Jake13735: HELLO
Jake13735: anybody home?
WarningTrack: Very funny - now tell me what you're talking about
Jake13735: in four months, we've accumulated the clients you see on that list
WarningTrack: Do you have an example of a site that allowed you to go your own "creative way", yes or no?
Jake13735: as of this point, they have all had their own customary design in mind, and we just did it to their liking...nothing "excellent" by your standards obviously
WarningTrack: Ok, so you havn't gotten to make it look as cool as you'd like - so I'm judging you on what you've done. It's all I can judge you on right now.
WarningTrack: Yes, nothing excellent - I'm not excellent at what I do either. I need a lot more practice in it
WarningTrack: How old are you?
Jake13735: then what the hell was the problem, about 25 minutes ago I agreed with what you just said, five seconds ago
Jake13735: I'm 16
WarningTrack: You said that you were ashamed that I judged you on the sites you did for free - just pointing out that I judged you by all those sites I saw. All the ones you've done so far.
WarningTrack: Which is all I *can* judge you by, really
Jake13735: are you done?
WarningTrack: With replying to what you said? Yes
WarningTrack: You didn't seem to understand what I mean 'til just now
Jake13735: business tip*
Jake13735: write a book on excellence, you seem to have it to a pinpoint
WarningTrack: Very funny - I don't claim to be excellent, or perfect, or even close
WarningTrack: But if you say something, and I know it to be wrong, I reply and point it out. Wow, I must think I'm God, huh?
Jake13735: then stop degrading me to make yourself feel better
WarningTrack: I'm not trying to degrade you, I'm pointing out inaccuraces - there a problem with that?
Jake13735: yes
WarningTrack: Look, you've got the wrong idea. This is the second time man - you say something, I argue with it, and then you tell me that I'n harping on you about it.
Jake13735: which is what you're so freakishly unable to realize
WarningTrack: If you don't want me pointing out these things, then don't say them.
Jake13735: how on earth does your mother put up with you?
Jake13735: do you correct everything she does?
Jake13735: do you tell her her cooking is done poorly
WarningTrack: Like a normal human being Jake: if she says something wrong
WarningTrack: , and I argue, and I'm right, she admits it
WarningTrack: Normal human beings are not offended when someone points out their mistakes
Jake13735: if I made a mistake, I wouldn't be offended
WarningTrack: You did make a mistake
Jake13735: when you correct it
Jake13735: I made a mistake by talking to you
