28/01/01 - Version 2.03 released.       Changed all \r\n to \n. Begrudgingly.

05/11/00 - Version 2.02 released.       Fixed bug when using multiple config files
                                        and using invalid_email redirect. Added 
                                        two variables for templates, {time} and
                                        {date}. Added possibility for multiple
						    servernames.

01/07/00 - Version 2.00 released.       Added config files, bad ip/host checking,
                                        extra variables for templates, external
                                        error pages. All config variables are now
                                        available to the form (except security
                                        related ones). Major code redesign, hence
                                        the major version increment.

                                        now work correctly under win32. Added support
                                        for file uploads under Php4.

                                        fixes. Also added the debug feature, so that if
