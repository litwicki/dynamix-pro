                        interactivity to your site. CGI allows you to do
                        everything from search your website, to getting
                        information from your customers for purchases or other
                        uses. The web is no longer a point and click world -
                        it's an interactive, evolving universe. Isn't it time
                        your site evolved to adapt to the new technologies
                        available? Working with a DynamixPro Programmer, you
